# Evaluating the system interms of Safety, Simplicity and Reliability

The system is simple, safe and reliable and the conditions can be analysed as follows:

1. Safety:
   The system ensures safety as:

   I. The system lowers the gate before the train arrives which gives enough time for the vehicles to either clear or stop before the gates lower down.

   II. The system sends an alert to the train in the case of a trapped vehicle once the gates are lowered ensuring safety.

   III. In the case of any system failure, the gates are lowered and warining is given inorder to prevent any accidents.

2. Simplicity:
   The system is simple to implement as:

   I. The system makes use of simple motion sensors inorder to detect the approach of the trains and does not implement any complex algorithms.

   II. The system does not include any complex calculations and are based only on true and false signals sent by the sensors.

3. Reliability:
   The system is reliable as:

   I. Sensors do not require high power supply and can function well even with low power supply and sensors are reliable.

   II. The system is based on sensors and signals so it reduces the risk of human errors.
