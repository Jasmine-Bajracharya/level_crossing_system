# AI Integration

While building the logic and ideas for the system, AI has assisted me in improving the logic and flow of the system. Copilot suggested me some improvements in logic so that the system would be a more robust and reliable system. Copilot suggested me to include a condition where if anything fails, the system defaults to gates lowered and warning and bells on inorder to prevent any accidents and ensure safety.

I asked copilot the potential issues in my word code and it has pointed out a mistake in word coding as I had mentioned "MONITOR THE TRAIN APPROACH" in the beginning of the code and in the bottom part I had written "CHECK FOR TRAIN APPROACH SIGNAL". This creates a confusion even though it means the same thing and the mistake had been corrected. It also suggested me to maintain system state like the state of train as IDLE, ACTIVE, and so on.
It also suggested me to opt for a bit complex concept for vehicle stuck in the intersection as I have made an assumption that if the signal is true, it represents vehicle is stuck but there can be other cases of vehicle is moving but gates have already been lowered.
