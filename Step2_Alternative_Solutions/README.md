# Alternative Solutions

## Alternative Solution 1: Using Object detection with sensors

While sensors are great for detecting if the train is approaching the level crossing or not, a more powerful solution could be integrating object detection algorithms.

Using the sensors, the sensors send a signal inorder to know if the train is approaching the intersection or not. Along with using sensors on the railway track, a camera can also be used to confirm the approach of the train. On the confirmation of the train approach, the gates are lowered. Also, an object detection algorithm can be utilized inorder to detect any vehicles that are stuck on the intersection after the gates have been closed. In the case of detection of the vehicle, alert signals can be sent to the train to either slow the train or stop the train. This system ensures safety for the vehicles as well as trains.

## Alternative solution 2: Time based solution for opening and closing of the gates.

The system is driven by a clock and works according to the scheduled time of the trains. The system inputs the scheduled time of the train arrival and closes the gate before certain time. The warning signals are sent before the gate closes inorder to ensure that the vehicles are cleared from the intersection before the train arrives. Assuming that the train passes at the scheduled time, the gates are then opened after the train has passed with certain delay added.

For example, if the train is scheduled to arrive at 1 PM and it takes 3 minutes for the train to pass, the warning lights and bells are activated at around 12:58 and the gates are lowered at 12:59 PM. The train then passes completely through the intersection by 1:03 PM and the gates are reopened after 2 minutes(that is at 1:05PM).

## Research on Crossing Gate Control System : The Type F level Crossings - Callaghans Lane, NSW

Various level crossings in Australia make use of the type F level crossing which utilises automated system with flashing red lights, audible alarms and full boom or half boom gates to control the vehicles on the road as the train approraches. These also make use of advanced warning lights which gives a more distant warning to the road users. The type F level crossing is of failsafe design which means that the warnings continues to operate and the gates are lowered until the faults are fixed or the operation is cancelled by the emergency switches.

Switches to control the warning equipment are located in locked boxes near the level crossing. It also consists of emergency switch boxes which allow manual manipulation of the boom. The system allows pedestrians to cross once the train has passed and when train is approaching the level crossing, the warnings are activated and the booms are lowered.
Once the train has crossed the intersection, the warning lights are turned off and the booms are raised.

This system is implemented in many level crossings like Callaghans Lane, NSW. The system is solar powered, wireless and modular in design. The system goes into a stop sign mode in the case of any disruption and becomes like a passive crossing where motorists have to obey the stop sign rules.
