# Assignment 1: Level Crossing System

### Submitted by: Jasmine Bajracharya(Student ID: u3312590)

#### The system is designed for a level crossing gate control system which makes use of sensors in order to detect the trains and vehicles on the track. The system must default to lowering the gates in the case of any failures to ensure full safety and the gates are to be opened only when there is no train and no vehicle on the track.
